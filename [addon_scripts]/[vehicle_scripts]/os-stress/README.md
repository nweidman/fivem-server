# os-stress-addon

A standalone stress system, designed to work with JG HUD out of the box. I already like qbx_hud's stress system, but don't understand why it's built into qbx_hud, and is not a separate resource.

This is all this resource provides. qbx_hud's stress system, in a separate resource, and will work out of the box with JG HUD with no additional configuration required.

All it does is update the LocalPlayer's statebag with the `stress` key. In case you want to use this with a different HUD!

qbx_hud: https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_hud

_This resource is standalone; and works with any framework such as Qbox, QB, ESX, ND etc, or no framework at all._

### Requirements

- ox_lib [[original](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)] [[maintained fork](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib)]
- OneSync Infinity

### Fetching the player's current stress level

```lua
local stress = LocalPlayer.state.stress or 0
```

### Resetting/reducing the player's stress level

```lua
local amountToReduceBy = 100
local state = LocalPlayer.state
state:set("stress", math.max(0, (state.stress or 0) - amountToReduceBy))
```

This script also includes the server sided event `hud:server:RelieveStress`, to relieve stress with existing Qbox/QBCore integrations.
