### Step 1:
Put the folder into your resources folder

### Step 2:
Add the power washer weapon to your inventory/framework.

You can find the item/weapon templates and icons within the `_installation` folder

The weapon name is `WEAPON_KQPOWERWASHER`

- Most modern inventories have a separate list file for weapons. You likely do not add them to the items list. You should have a separate list of weapons. Make sure to look into the docs of the inventory system that you're using

### Step 3: (optional)
Add the `powerwashing` job to your server.

#### ESX:
To add the `powerwashing` job, simply import the sql file: `_installation/esx_job.sql`.
Then restart your server

#### QBCore / QBox
Open your jobs list file (usually found in `/shared/jobs.lua`)

Copy the job data from `_installation/qb_job.txt` and add it to your jobs list. Then restart your server

### Step 4:
Ensure the script in your `server.cfg` file.
```
ensure kq_link
ensure kq_jobcontracts
ensure kq_powerwashing_mlo
ensure kq_powerwashing
```

### Done
Enjoy the script
